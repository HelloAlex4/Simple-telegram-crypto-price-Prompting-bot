# Simple-telegram-crypto-price-Prompting-bot

This project is just a simple telegram bot where users can request current crypto prices.

The program logs all user requests to a log.txt file.

If someone would like to add additional telegram commands to the file than this could be done very easily.

The crypto prices are accesed via the bybit exchange API.
For the telegram integration the Telegram API is being used.

This project plays a bigger part in a crypto trading bot I am currently working on, where users can acces their account information with Telegram.
